            üê± Cat Sitting: Cats are fascinating creatures, and I take joy in
            catering to their independent yet affectionate nature. Whether your
            feline friend needs playtime, cuddles, or just a cozy spot to relax,
            I ensure they feel right at home.

            üê∂ Dog Sitting: Dogs are not just pets; they're family. From
            energetic walks and engaging playtime to soothing belly rubs, I
            provide a balanced and fun experience for dogs of all sizes and
            breeds. Safety and happiness are my top priorities.
            <br />
            üêá Rabbit Sitting: With their adorable antics and gentle
            personalities, rabbits require a special kind of care. I am
            well-versed in providing them with a comfortable environment,
            appropriate diet, and ample playtime to keep them content and
            hopping with joy.
